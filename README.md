# Order of the Moon
Order of the Moon is an exclusive and independent NFT & DAO created for limited distribution between the 22 holders of the token. Each token represents one of the 22 Major Arcana of Tarot. Tokens cannot be exchanged unless the transaction is signed off on by at least 3 "witnesses." 

Tokens are updated once every moon cycle for attendees. Upon update, experience points are added to the token and it can increase in rank as a show of participation in the order. 

## Ranks
Ranks exist within the order and each rank has varying permissions and responsibilities when interacting with other members both on and off chain. 

### High Priestess
High Priestess(HP) is the highest rank in the order. It is the responsibility of the HP to host and lead the events. The rank of High Priestess can be transferred or loaned at any time and exists separate the token. 

### Priestess 
Priestess is the second highest rank within the order. There can be as many as (Q) priestesses in the order. Off-chain, a priestess' power is comparable to the HP, but they have limited on-chain permissions. Specifically, the Priestess gains an additional vote when the High Priestess isn't present, and they are freely able to promote or demote member ranks.

## Exchanging Tokens
These tokens are not meant to be easily exchanged. The High Priest (owner) and two other holders must sign off on a transaction before it can be initiated on the blockchain. The token **can**, however, be loaned out for a single moon cycle to another holder of the token. This loaning process allows for a member to assume the rank and responsibilities of the token owner in the event that the owner of the token is unable to make it.

## Cloning Tokens
A token holder can "clone" their token once every cycle. These cloned tokens can be given to the uninitiated to grant them event access alongside the token owner. No more than (X) cloned tokens can be held at one time. The duration of the cloned token can be refreshed at any time by the token holder. 

## Revoking Membership 
Holders of the token can vote on the membership of others. Proposals are put to a vote and last for 1 week. Majority rule. Removed members have their tokens returned to the treasury for the duration stated in the proposal. If the proposal is for an indefinite removal, tokens are placed into the treasury until a suitable replacement is voted on. 

### Time-based Revocation 
In the event that a member is unable to make (N) consecutive cycles, their membership is automatically revoked. This timer can be reset at anytime **prior** to the revocation by the High Priest. 

## Adding Members
A holder of a cloned token with enough attendance experience can be voted on for a full membership by a majority of the existing token holders. 

## Promoting Members
Members can only be upgraded by a Priestess or High Priestess. Upgrades increase the permissions with which a member can interact with other members on the blockchain. 

## Demoting Members
