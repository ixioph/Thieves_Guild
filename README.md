# Thieves Guild
Thieves Guild is a RPG-inspired exclusive and anonymous DAO with membership represented by an NFT. Ownership of a token grants membership and event access both on and off chain. Tokens cannot be exchanged unless the transaction is signed off on by a set number of holders.

Tokens are updated once every moon cycle for attendees. Upon update, experience points are added to the token and it can increase in rank as a show of participation in the guild. 

## Spirits
The NFT. Spirits are NFT tokens, with custom membership caps and names. Here, they represent the cards in a tarot deck. Spirits are unique and limited in number. 

## Loot
Loot ($LOOT) is the token associated with the DAO. Loot can be exchanged anonymously between members and the value of loot is backed by **guild-approved** assets that are bonded to the token. Loot can essentially be seen as an ETF of the collective assets in the treasury. 

## Ranks
Ranks exist within the guild and each rank has varying permissions and responsibilities when interacting with other members both on and off chain. 

### Guildmaster
Guildmaster is the highest rank in the guild. It is the responsibility of the GM to host and lead events. The rank of Guildmaster can be transferred or loaned at any time and exists separate the token. 

### Master Thief 
Master Thief is the second highest rank within the order. The number of master thieves in the guild can be set. Off-chain, a MT's power is comparable to the GM, but they have limited on-chain permissions. Specifically, the MT gains an additional vote when the GM isn't present, and they are freely able to promote or demote member ranks. 

### Operative
Off-chain, an operative is no different than a thief. On-chain, operatives have additional access including invite and promoting permissions.

### Scout
To compliment the Operative, Scouts have planning and organizational permissions for off-chain events, but on-chain they are no different than a thief.

### Thief
The basic rank of a full member. Can invite, in the form of cloning, once per moon cycle.

### Apprentice
An entry rank. Apprentices cannot clone or invite.

## Titles
In addition to ranks, full members can also have unique titles. Titles are assigned by the masters of the guild and are effectively aliases for addressing members both on and off chain. 

## Transactions 
Transactions between members of the guild using the LOOT coin are anonymous. 

## Exchanging Tokens
These tokens are not meant to be easily exchanged. The Guildmaster and two other holders (of rank Thief or higher) must sign off on a transaction before it can be initiated on the blockchain. The token **can**, however, be loaned out for a single moon cycle to another holder of the token. This loaning process allows for a member to assume the rank and responsibilities of the token owner in the event that the owner of the token is unable to make it.

## Cloning Tokens
A token holder can "clone" their token once every cycle. These cloned tokens can be given to the uninitiated to grant them event access alongside the token owner. The maximum number of cloned tokens that can be held can be set by the Guildmaster. The duration of the cloned token that has been given out can be refreshed at any time by the token holder. 

## Revoking Membership 
Holders of the token can vote on the membership of others. Proposals are put to a vote and last for 1 week. Majority rule. Removed members have their tokens returned to the treasury for the duration stated in the proposal. If the proposal is for an indefinite removal, tokens are placed into the treasury until a suitable replacement is voted on. 

### Time-based Revocation 
In the event that a member is unable to make (N) consecutive cycles, their membership is automatically revoked. This timer can be reset at anytime **prior** to the revocation by the Guildmaster. 

## Adding Members
A holder of a cloned token with enough attendance experience can be voted on for a full membership by a majority of the existing token holders. 

## Promoting Members
Members can only be upgraded by the Guildmaster, Master Thief, and Operative ranks. Upgrades increase the permissions with which a member can interact with other members on and off the blockchain. 

## Demoting Members
Demotion privileges are only enabled on the Guildmaster and Master Thief.
