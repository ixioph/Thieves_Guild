# Thieves Guild
Thieves Guild is an anonymous DAO and digital asset trading platform with exclusive membership represented by an NFT. Tokens cannot be exchanged without putting in a request and receiving vote approval from the existing holders.

Tokens generate experience with time, and this experience increases voting rights for the holder. 

Holders can elect to support the swapping of specific assets at set buy and sell values. This will allow the swap to act as a sort of "permanent liquidity" for its members.


## Spirits
The NFT. Spirits are NFT tokens, with custom membership caps and names. Here, they represent the cards in a tarot deck. Spirits are unique and limited in number. 


## Loot
Loot ($LOOT) is the token associated with the DAO. Loot can be exchanged between members and the value of loot is backed by **guild-approved** assets that are bonded to the token. Loot can essentially be seen as an ETF of the collective assets in the treasury. 


## Ranks
As tokens gain experience, the NFT increases in rank. 

### Master Thief 
The fifth and highest rank

### Operative
The fourth rank.

### Scout
The third rank.

### Thief
The second rank, for Level 1 members.

### Apprentice
The starter rank for Level 0 members.


## Exchanging Tokens
These tokens are not meant to be easily exchanged. The Guildmaster and two other holders (of rank Thief or higher) must sign off on a transaction before it can be initiated on the blockchain. The token **can**, however, be loaned out for a single moon cycle to another holder of the token. This loaning process allows for a member to assume the rank and responsibilities of the token owner in the event that the owner of the token is unable to make it.

## Revoking Membership 
Holders of the token can vote on the membership of others. Proposals are put to a vote and last for 1 week. Majority rule. Removed members have their tokens returned to the treasury for the duration stated in the proposal. If the proposal is for an indefinite removal, tokens are placed into the treasury until a suitable replacement is voted on. 

## Adding Members
New token holders are voted on by the existing holders. 

## Demoting Members
Should the existing holders choose, they can vote to lower the rank of another member.
